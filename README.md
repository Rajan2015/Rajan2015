**About Me**

Iâ€™m **Rajan Garg**, a Technical Architect at a product-based tech company, driving scalable solutions across .NET, Python, and cloud-native architectures. I specialize in designing enterprise-grade systems using .NET on Azure, AKS, event-driven architectures, and containerized microservices. I lead architecture reviews and mentor engineering teams, ensuring quality, performance, and long-term maintainability.

Currently exploring the intersection of AI and productivity. I'm building AI-powered developer tools and domain-specific bots using OpenAI, RAG, and Vector DBs, with a focus on hallucination reduction and explainability.

**Tech Stack & Interests**
- Backend: .NET 8, Azure Functions (Isolated), gRPC, Python (FastAPI)
- Cloud & DevOps: Azure, ACR, AKS, Argo CD, GitHub Actions
- AI/ML: Azure OpenAI, LangChain, Embeddings, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Observability: New Relic, OpenTelemetry, Seq, Custom Telemetry Pipelines
- Patterns: Repository Pattern, Factory Pattern, Circuit Breakers, Retry/Timeout Strategies

**Current Focus**
- Building in public: Sharing real-world AI implementation journeys on LinkedIn
- Developing open-source tooling to bridge architecture best practices with AI innovation
- Championing developer productivity through automation and intelligent observability
